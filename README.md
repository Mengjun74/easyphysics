# easyphysics

A package with useful physics formulas to make physics easy and fun for users! The authors are Revathy Ponnambalam, Nikita Susan Easow, Yaou Hu and Mengjun Chen. It uses four functions to easily calculate four classic physics theories. By making the functions concise and supporting graphs to demonstrate the theories, physics beginners might find learning physics fun and not daunting! All functions in this package require only arguments in numeric format; no dataset files are needed.  `easyphysics` can also generate easy-to-understand visualizations to further reveal the physics effects.  

## Installation

```bash
$ pip install easyphysics
```

## Usage

The package has four functions which can provide solutions for Physics Equations. Input will be taken from the User and the solutions will be provided by the functions. The four functions are as follows: 


- `freefall()` calculates the time needed for a falling object to reach the ground using the equation of motion. The distance traveled by the falling object and the acceleration of gravity are the functionâ€™s arguments. 

## Fitting into the Python ecosystem

A similar well-known package [sympy](https://github.com/sympy/sympy) is available, which has a [module in physics](https://docs.sympy.org/latest/reference/public/physics/index.html).`sympy` is a library for symbolic computation. The physics module focuses on solving advanced physics problems such as Hydrogen Wavefunction and Quantum physics.

`easyphysics` targets physics beginners rather than professionals, such as middle schoolers and people new to physics. It uses four functions to easily calculate four classic physics theories. By making the functions concise and supporting graphs to demonstrate the theories, physics beginners might find learning physics fun and not daunting! All functions in this package require only arguments in numeric format; no dataset files are needed.  `easyphysics` can also generate easy-to-understand visualizations to further reveal the physics effects.  The specific functions and visual components make  `easyphysics` different from other packages.
