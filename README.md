# easyphysics

A package with useful physics formulas to make physics easy and fun for users! The authors are Revathy Ponnambalam, Nikita Susan Easow, Yaou Hu and Mengjun Chen.

## Installation

```bash
$ pip install easyphysics
```

## Usage

The package has four functions which can provide solutions for Physics Equations. Input will be taken from the User and the solutions will be provided by the functions. The four functions are as follows: 


- **freefall()** calculates the distance traveled by a falling object using the equation of motion. This function returns the time it takes for a free fall.

## Fitting into the Python ecosystem

A similar package [sympy](https://github.com/sympy/sympy) is available, which has a [module in physics](https://docs.sympy.org/latest/reference/public/physics/index.html).'sympy' is a library for symbolic computation. The physics module focuses on solving advanced physics problems such as Hydrogen Wavefunction and Quantum physics.

`easyphysics` is targeted at physics beginners rather than professionals. We aim to use four functions to explain four basic physics formulas and make learning physics easy and fun.
